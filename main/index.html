			<h3>Its on Github</h3>
			<p>
				There have been some minor changes here and there recently, but most importantly, Jupiter and Wayfire Integrator are now online on Github. From now on I also want to try to work properly with Git and track the individual steps.</br>
				The Wayfire Integrator mentioned is currently used to work around the unfortunately existing limitations of Gtk 4 in the layer shell protocol. It's possible that there will be another solution for this purpose in the future, but I expect that I won't be able to get around a Wayfire plugin written in C++ for individual functions anyway. So I can already use it for this as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also already online is Neptune, a browser (well, a window and some functions around WebKitGtk) with which I also want to try out some ideas and possibilities. It is also helpful to have something more usable than the existing test app to get a better feeling for the actual usability.</br>
				Of course, I'd like to point out again that nothing of this is actually productively usable.

			<h3>Small steps</h3>
			<p>
				Since the last time I heavily improved many of my mockups got some new ideas and completle changed some of the ideas of window handeling, application use and more.<br />
				I've also started to write real code for Jupiter (the desktop shell). I the last year I've tried to start a simular project so some of the first steps where quit easy just because I rembered how to do it. To test some of the basic conzepts I've also written <a href="https://gist.github.com/mfxbe/63c1cbb261adab9917702ba760d7e83c">a very small app</a> in Lua (using lgi and of course Gtk4) which in future most likly will grow if there is more to be tested.<br />
				Jupiter itself is sitting on top of Wayfire (so it's deep in the wayland stuff) and already some DBus for communication between desktop and apps. As of now it is possible to change apps with <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MithosEU/mithoseu.github.io/master/main/data/pic2.png">a dock</a> on the left hand side (which will <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MithosEU/mithoseu.github.io/master/main/data/pic3.png">hide</a> if not used) also if the client is set up correctly the fitting "global menu" (I don't think of that term as very fitting because of the planed structure right now there normaly is only one big window, so every menu is kind of global) is displayed and working. Furthermore I tried to add some system menu buttons (just placeholders, no functions) for which I decided to use some icons from iconoir. It looks like a big and promising libary for simbolic icons. For the colorfull ones I chose the FlatWoken icon theme for the moment. Nothing of that is fixed but right now it looks quit good.

			<h3>Hello here</h3>
			<p>
				So, what is Mithos? I don't know exactly myself, but on the one hand it's an attempt to improve my knowledge in all possible areas of IT like C/Linux/Design/Hardware/... and to do this not in single steps but in a bigger project.<br />
				On the other hand, it's probably yet another distro and yet another working environment and yet another tool for this and that job that nobody needs. Don't worry, you probably never want to use it. Capability for a productive system is not one of my goals.<br />
				Today I'll start with a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MithosEU/mithoseu.github.io/master/main/data/pic1.webp">little sketch</a> from Inkscape that I clicked together a while ago that shows where I would like to work to. Yes thats quit a simular interface to the good old Unity but in my head I stared slowly moving away from that point.<br />
				And some more details: Right now I'm planing to build on a Debian system and wish to have everything run on an own physical system at the end (which probably never will be reached).
