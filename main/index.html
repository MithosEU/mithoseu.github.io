				So, what is Mithos? I don't know exactly myself, but on the one hand it's an attempt to improve my knowledge in all possible areas of IT like C/Linux/Design/Hardware/... and to do this not in single steps but in a bigger project.<br />
				On the other hand, it's probably yet another distro and yet another working environment and yet another tool for this and that job that nobody needs. Don't worry, you probably never want to use it. Capability for a productive system is not one of my goals.<br />
				Today I'll start with a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MithosEU/mithoseu.github.io/master/main/data/pic1.webp">little sketch</a> from Inkscape that I clicked together a while ago that shows where I would like to work to. Yes thats quit a simular interface to the good old Unity but in my head I stared slowly moving away from that point.<br />
				And some more details: Right now I'm planing to build on a Debian system and wish to have everything run on an own physical system at the end (which probably never will be reached).
